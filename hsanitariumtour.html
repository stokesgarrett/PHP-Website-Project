        through several chilling rooms. in the wardens office, you see a chainsaw with what looks like dried blood. another room, there multiple
        crumbling gaps to outside, with large freezers sitting inside. you arrive at the isolation room...

        an eternity, maria does not return. a piece of the isolation rooms roof violently falls down and crushes your friends head. in shock, you and your 
        remaining two friends look up and are greeted by a large man wearing a chilling white mask, weilding a machete. you feel impending doom, and realize 
        you must escape. you remember maria locked the entry door before the group entered.
